Cabins 'n Dirt
This app is a clone of HipCamp, an online marketplace for traveling campers to find and book spots with private hosts.

Live Site: https://cabinsndirt.herokuapp.com/

Cabins 'n Dirt was built with:
PostgreSQL
Ruby on Rails 5.2.3
ReactJS
Redux
SASS

These libraries allowed for readable, modular DOM components that were simple to style.

Features:
Cabins 'n Dirt currently allows a user to create an account and search a map for locations to camp.

Future:
Cabins 'n Dirt will implement the ability of a user to reserve a location, become a host and manage locations, write a review after a stay, and reach out to message a host.
